To run this reversi/othello game, run the file Main.java and edit the main method in that function in the line witht the call to startGUI. startGUI takes in a number of players and the color of the human player if one player is selected. For example: startGUI(2), startGUI(1), startGUI(1,"Black",computer), and startGUI(1,"White",computer) are all possible starting commands. The value of computer is the specific instance of AI to be used and is not important for the user to know. That is something that has been decided elsewhere. If startGUI(1) is chosen, the default human color is black.
